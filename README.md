# Predicting-NHL-player-Salaries

This is the final project of Math 5P87 - Statistical Learning course where we predict the salaries of NHL players during 2016-2017 NHL season using supervised learning regression techniques. The dataset is obtained from Kaggle. The project explores linear models including ridge regression and LASSO regression, as well as, non-linear models including kernel smoothing regression, XGBoost regression, and decision tree regression. The LASSO regression model is the most optimal model as judged by root mean squared error, with an RMSE of 1447595.
